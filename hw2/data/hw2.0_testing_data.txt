<SOS> is that what you really wanted to say <EOS>
<SOS> tom is probably going to be home soon <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't tie my own shoes yet <EOS>
<SOS> what did you eat for dinner last night <EOS>
<SOS> i know tom will hate me for this <EOS>
<SOS> i would n't quit if i were you <EOS>
<SOS> i can never get tom on the phone <EOS>
<SOS> it seems like there 's no money left <EOS>
<SOS> the two incidents are connected with each other <EOS>
<SOS> tom wanted a closer look at the blueprints <EOS>
<SOS> i fell asleep before my father came home <EOS>
<SOS> do tom and mary still live in boston <EOS>
<SOS> do you mind if i open the window <EOS>
<SOS> i 'd like to fax this to japan <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i were in boston right now <EOS>
<SOS> we hope this will be to your satisfaction <EOS>
<SOS> i had no idea tom could do that <EOS>
<SOS> i see why tom does n't like mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom lives in the woods all by himself <EOS>
<SOS> tom is happier now that mary has left <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't have to tell me this <EOS>
<SOS> mary can cook anything without using a recipe <EOS>

<SOS> i 'm going to name the baby tom <EOS>
<SOS> i got a b on my french test <EOS>

<SOS> tom did n't sound like he was kidding <EOS>
<SOS> i have to stay in bed all day <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom wanted to kill us both <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me how to get to his house <EOS>
<SOS> tom did it out of a sense of justice <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary are n't seeing each other anymore <EOS>
<SOS> when i heard that , i started to cry <EOS>
<SOS> they do n't understand me when i speak french <EOS>
<SOS> we do n't even know if it 's true <EOS>
<SOS> it seems that something is wrong with this car <EOS>
<SOS> it should n't be too hard to do that <EOS>
<SOS> it 's going to be very , very hot <EOS>
<SOS> she was playing the piano when the guests arrived <EOS>
<SOS> it 's very hard to tell what might happen <EOS>
<SOS> tom is going to laugh when he sees this <EOS>
<SOS> everybody knows you 're more intelligent than she is <EOS>
<SOS> i have n't checked my messages yet this morning <EOS>
<SOS> thank you for the present you gave my son <EOS>
<SOS> tom noticed a police car in the rear-view mirror <EOS>

<SOS> i suggest you turn around and go back home <EOS>
<SOS> are you sure it 's safe to eat this <EOS>
<SOS> the police officer asked me what my name was <EOS>
<SOS> she tried to persuade him to attend the meeting <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't do what tom said i did <EOS>
<SOS> i paid a lot of money for these tickets <EOS>

<SOS> this rule can not be applied to that case <EOS>
<SOS> the athletic meet was put off until next week <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm sorry , but i do n't understand <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder whether tom will like boston or not <EOS>

<SOS> i 'll get you out of this awful situation <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm sorry i had to cancel my appointment <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't like having to pay your bills <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me that he thought mary was nosy <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder why tom thought we should do that <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm the only one who likes doing that <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm really glad i got to meet you <EOS>
<SOS> today , i do n't feel like doing anything <EOS>
<SOS> tom says you may not need to come tomorrow <EOS>

<SOS> i thought you said you were bad at french <EOS>
<SOS> the united states had no commercial treaty with britain <EOS>
<SOS> i 've asked tom to do that for mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't volunteer to be a guinea pig <EOS>

<SOS> the union is pressing for a ten-percent pay hike <EOS>
<SOS> he comes to see my son now and then <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't seem to be afraid of mary <EOS>

<SOS> i do n't think tom ever really loved me <EOS>
<SOS> there 's a lot of dust in the attic <EOS>

<SOS> he got into this school in september last year <EOS>
<SOS> tom said that he plays the flute , too <EOS>
<SOS> maybe tom could n't afford to buy a ticket <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't have anything to feel guilty about <EOS>
<SOS> he had no idea why his wife left him <EOS>
<SOS> there was no tv or radio in those days <EOS>
<SOS> it took me a long time to fall asleep <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't tell me what the problem was <EOS>
<SOS> there are a lot of fish in the sea <EOS>
<SOS> if i were you , i 'd ask him <EOS>
<SOS> we had hoped you could do it for us <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't think mary would catch a fish <EOS>
<SOS> i hope i 'll never have that problem again <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll call you up again in an hour <EOS>
<SOS> he wo n't come in a rain like this <EOS>
<SOS> tom was n't doing that , but mary was <EOS>
<SOS> tom did his best to help mary learn french <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't want mary to stay any longer <EOS>
<SOS> tom wanted to turn himself in to the police <EOS>
<SOS> he is relied on by everyone in the class <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm reluctant to tell tom to do that <EOS>
<SOS> you have no idea how good you have it <EOS>
<SOS> tom could n't stand being alone , could he <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me that he thought mary was thirty <EOS>

<SOS> tom and mary had their old house torn down <EOS>
<SOS> why did you break up with your last boyfriend <EOS>

<SOS> i wo n't tell anyone if you do n't <EOS>
<SOS> i walked down the hall to tom 's office <EOS>

<SOS> the more i get , the more i want <EOS>
<SOS> this book is easy enough for me to read <EOS>
<SOS> you did n't tell me mary was so beautiful <EOS>
<SOS> these shoes are obviously not large enough for tom <EOS>
<SOS> tom is doing everything mary asked him to do <EOS>
<SOS> i want to be with you whenever i can <EOS>
<SOS> tom is just trying to make us feel guilty <EOS>
<SOS> you seem a little better than you were before <EOS>
<SOS> tom has a lot of things to deal with <EOS>
<SOS> do you still want to see a movie later <EOS>
<SOS> tom says mary did n't seem to be hungry <EOS>
<SOS> you should make sure your children are eating enough <EOS>
<SOS> confine your remarks to the matter we are discussing <EOS>
<SOS> the following morning , the snowman was completely melted <EOS>
<SOS> with these headphones , i ca n't hear anything <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm fairly sure tom is in boston now <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm going to do that first thing tomorrow <EOS>
<SOS> why do n't they just come and get us <EOS>
<SOS> perhaps we should find out what tom 's doing <EOS>
<SOS> tom is still waiting for mary to get there <EOS>

<SOS> would you like to join us for some drinks <EOS>
<SOS> we went to the beach and swam all day <EOS>

<SOS> i think tom will drive me to the airport <EOS>
<SOS> how much did it cost you to get there <EOS>

<SOS> these birds migrate to north africa in the winter <EOS>
<SOS> that was a stupid thing for you to do <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm not a big fan of blueberry pancakes <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think tom should do that outside <EOS>
<SOS> i kind of wished you 'd mentioned that before <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder when tom wanted mary to do that <EOS>
<SOS> are n't you going to tom 's birthday party <EOS>
<SOS> i wish somebody would tell me what to do <EOS>

<SOS> i 'd like a glass of water , please <EOS>
<SOS> you 've never had a girlfriend , have you <EOS>
<SOS> he came to see you right after you left <EOS>
<SOS> tom was surprised when mary ate all three sandwiches <EOS>
<SOS> nothing is likely to be more effective than this <EOS>
<SOS> perhaps we can talk about this at another time <EOS>
<SOS> keep an eye on my bag for a while <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't get on the train with mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom does n't know the boy talking to mary <EOS>
<SOS> i was n't the one who told tom that <EOS>
<SOS> marriage is n't a subject that interests young people <EOS>
<SOS> tom is helping mary get ready for the party <EOS>
<SOS> tom is never coming home again , is he <EOS>
<SOS> i just wanted to make sure i was right <EOS>
<SOS> he is a good match for me in tennis <EOS>
<SOS> we walked up and down the streets of kyoto <EOS>
<SOS> this is a mistake students are apt to make <EOS>
<SOS> there are more girls than boys in this school <EOS>
<SOS> perhaps tom wo n't be able to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't think it would rain last night <EOS>
<SOS> sorry , i did n't mean to scare you <EOS>
<SOS> tom convinced me that it was n't his fault <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't mean to eavesdrop on your conversation <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm really looking forward to my birthday party <EOS>
<SOS> tom grabbed one of the shovels and started digging <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom should give mary a second chance <EOS>
<SOS> tom denied he was the one who did that <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't believe it 's been a year <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm still not sure i can help you <EOS>
<SOS> he has a habit of keeping the door open <EOS>
<SOS> that was the best meal i 've ever eaten <EOS>
<SOS> do we need to tell tom what to do <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm sorry to cause you all this trouble <EOS>
<SOS> tom is kind of famous , is n't he <EOS>
<SOS> she was asked to write her name in ink <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't just sit back and do nothing <EOS>
<SOS> tom is a handsome man , is n't he <EOS>
<SOS> tom was in the closet , hiding from mary <EOS>
<SOS> my grandmother is still vigorous at 82 years old <EOS>
<SOS> i know this has n't been easy for you <EOS>
<SOS> that 's exactly what i 've been telling tom <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think mary would leave her husband <EOS>
<SOS> sooner or later , i 'll probably get bored <EOS>
<SOS> tom is at least a foot taller than mary <EOS>
<SOS> she made my mother take care of the baby <EOS>
<SOS> tom came to our house several times last summer <EOS>
<SOS> tom knew mary was n't going to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm so happy to finally be back home <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm afraid you 've taken the wrong seat <EOS>
<SOS> children depend on their parents for food and clothing <EOS>
<SOS> tom is the brother of one of the victims <EOS>
<SOS> you must 've been surprised to see tom there <EOS>
<SOS> can you tell me how much a ticket costs <EOS>
<SOS> tickets are available to the public for $ 30 <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder why tom did n't go with mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom and i have n't talked in a while <EOS>
<SOS> you 're not supportive of anyone in this family <EOS>
<SOS> bring me a cup of coffee , will you <EOS>
<SOS> he ran for his life when the bear appeared <EOS>
<SOS> tom knew he no longer needed to do that <EOS>
<SOS> do tom and mary know why you 're here <EOS>
<SOS> i want to meet the girl of my dreams <EOS>
<SOS> tom made tuna fish sandwiches for mary and john <EOS>
<SOS> do you think tom knows how mary did that <EOS>
<SOS> he made up his mind to be a fireman <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm really happy i came here with you <EOS>
<SOS> i 'd like to have a glass of water <EOS>
<SOS> tom had dreams of becoming a famous tennis player <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll do that if you ask me to <EOS>
<SOS> tom led the group of men into his office <EOS>
<SOS> i heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen <EOS>
<SOS> tom tried to sleep , but he could n't <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he did n't know much about boston <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't mean to make you feel bad <EOS>
<SOS> why were you the last one to do that <EOS>
<SOS> my uncle brought a new tv set for us <EOS>
<SOS> have they found out what happened to that airplane <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't have a desk in my bedroom <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me that he thought mary was unemployed <EOS>
<SOS> how long do you think they have been married <EOS>
<SOS> tom said mozart is one of his favorite composers <EOS>
<SOS> you miss them a lot , do n't you <EOS>
<SOS> we sold those to them , did n't we <EOS>
<SOS> i told tom i was going to handle it <EOS>
<SOS> i was just going to do that for you <EOS>
<SOS> how many hours a day do you study french <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he was going to take a bath <EOS>
<SOS> tom seems to know all about mary 's past <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll do this as long as i can <EOS>
<SOS> hurry up , or you 'll miss the bus <EOS>
<SOS> there is a subtle difference between the two words <EOS>
<SOS> the picture of the tower was out of focus <EOS>
<SOS> that is n't wine . it 's grape juice <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think tom knows anything about farming <EOS>
<SOS> why do n't we try doing this again tomorrow <EOS>
<SOS> tom wanted to know more about mary 's family <EOS>
<SOS> let 's just get on with it , ok <EOS>

<SOS> i want my children to learn to speak french <EOS>

<SOS> tom does n't want to see mary get hurt <EOS>

<SOS> i 'd like to know what 's happening here <EOS>
<SOS> the captain is responsible for the safety of passengers <EOS>
<SOS> do not tell me you feel sorry for me <EOS>
<SOS> i thought tom would be in boston by now <EOS>
<SOS> tom put the cans of beans on the shelf <EOS>
<SOS> she can play tennis , and so can i <EOS>
<SOS> everyone in the room was doing the same thing <EOS>
<SOS> it was tom who asked mary to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll be back in time for the meeting <EOS>
<SOS> if tom does n't do that , who will <EOS>

<SOS> tom lay in bed staring up at the ceiling <EOS>
<SOS> i want you out of our apartment by morning <EOS>
<SOS> my wife and i have a joint bank account <EOS>
<SOS> tom says you may not need to do that <EOS>
<SOS> my teeth are totally healthy and free of problems <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't think of anything that might help <EOS>
<SOS> i am proud of having accomplished such a task <EOS>
<SOS> the birth rate and death rate were nearly equal <EOS>
<SOS> with her heart pounding , she opened the door <EOS>
<SOS> i still have things stored in tom 's garage <EOS>
<SOS> he will be my deputy while i am away <EOS>
<SOS> have you seen tom since you 've been back <EOS>

<SOS> tom is making a list of what he needs <EOS>
<SOS> tom beat mary to death with a baseball bat <EOS>
<SOS> he is concerned about the result of the exam <EOS>
<SOS> tom is scared of you , is n't he <EOS>
<SOS> he broke down when he heard the bad news <EOS>
<SOS> i found out when we 're supposed to arrive <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think anyone could have stopped tom <EOS>
<SOS> tom had a lot of fun at the party <EOS>
<SOS> i think it 's still too early to celebrate <EOS>
<SOS> i just want a straight answer . nothing more <EOS>
<SOS> it was tom 's idea to sell our house <EOS>

<SOS> there is no shame in admitting one 's faults <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm pretty sure tom would n't be interested <EOS>

<SOS> i saw tom getting into a dark blue van <EOS>
<SOS> you gave tom my message , did n't you <EOS>

<SOS> do you happen to know where tom was born <EOS>
<SOS> what 's faster , a taxi or the subway <EOS>
<SOS> i just ca n't believe tom would do that <EOS>
<SOS> the mayor appropriated city money for his own use <EOS>
<SOS> tom and i did n't do that by ourselves <EOS>

<SOS> it seemed pretty important to me at the time <EOS>
<SOS> when was the last time you saw the cat <EOS>
<SOS> tom does n't know what mary wants to buy <EOS>
<SOS> we 've already been here for over an hour <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm the one who 's been lied to <EOS>

<SOS> the police officer asked tom to empty his pockets <EOS>
<SOS> i think i 'll go to boston next summer <EOS>
<SOS> i need you to tell me when you plan to arrive <EOS>
<SOS> tom opened his suitcase again and put some more things in <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder what made tom think mary ought to do that <EOS>
<SOS> what were you doing between two and four o'clock yesterday afternoon <EOS>
<SOS> you never can tell what might happen if tom meets mary <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think tom knows where mary usually goes skiing <EOS>
<SOS> tom is n't going to get away with it this time <EOS>
<SOS> i always have trouble sleeping the night before a big concert <EOS>
<SOS> tom asked mary to throw the rotten apple into the garbage <EOS>
<SOS> someone must 've told tom , but it was n't me <EOS>
<SOS> i was the one who told tom not to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom pretended not to notice that mary was looking at him <EOS>
<SOS> is this the first time you 've applied for a loan <EOS>
<SOS> the thief cut the telephone lines before breaking into the house <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't have enough money to buy everything he needed <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm sure tom did n't intend to hurt your feelings <EOS>
<SOS> i think we have enough time to finish doing that today <EOS>
<SOS> you 're falling in love with me , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom could 've done that without mary 's help <EOS>
<SOS> are you sure that tom has n't been lying to us <EOS>
<SOS> are you sure you do n't want to take a break <EOS>
<SOS> do you really think that kind of thing can be done <EOS>
<SOS> tom goes to the barber less than four times a year <EOS>

<SOS> tom said that mary was the last one to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom has a good chance of being hired for the job <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't trust mary as much as she trusted him <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't make heads or tails of what you said <EOS>
<SOS> i certainly had no idea tom would be coming over tonight <EOS>
<SOS> how long can we hold out against the superior enemy attacks <EOS>
<SOS> my guess is that tom is n't going to want that <EOS>
<SOS> in some cases , emeralds can be worth more than diamonds <EOS>
<SOS> there 's no reason for you not to tell tom that <EOS>
<SOS> you 're one of tom 's kids , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> i need to go get some money out of the bank <EOS>
<SOS> allied military leaders found a way to defeat the japanese plan <EOS>
<SOS> if he knew her phone number , he could call her <EOS>
<SOS> tom is n't my boyfriend . he 's just a friend <EOS>
<SOS> tom wo n't be angry if mary does n't do that <EOS>
<SOS> we should lay down a few ground rules before we begin <EOS>
<SOS> it 's really dark here . i ca n't see anything <EOS>
<SOS> tom wanted mary to go to the post office for him <EOS>

<SOS> no matter what you say , i wo n't give up <EOS>
<SOS> we need to save up money to buy a new car <EOS>
<SOS> you 're not the only one who does n't like tom <EOS>
<SOS> tom lay on his bed and cried softly into his pillow <EOS>
<SOS> first , let us talk about the experiments conducted in laboratories <EOS>
<SOS> it was n't hard to convince tom not to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom is lying on his back , staring at the ceiling <EOS>
<SOS> tom was n't the one who told mary to do that <EOS>
<SOS> you seem to know a lot about tom and his family <EOS>
<SOS> tom is hoping that he can hitch a ride to boston <EOS>
<SOS> mary said she 'd try to convince tom to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think we should go to tom 's party <EOS>
<SOS> tom is the one who needs to deal with this problem <EOS>
<SOS> i told you tom would give me something for my birthday <EOS>
<SOS> how are people going to know what needs to be done <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder why tom did n't tell me to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i promise i wo n't tell anyone that you 're rich <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll do whatever it takes to keep our family together <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he thought i might not have to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i get the impression that you are n't telling the truth <EOS>
<SOS> tom said that he does n't want to do that again <EOS>
<SOS> how long would it take to get to boston from here <EOS>
<SOS> tom says he did n't know mary helped john do that <EOS>
<SOS> a friend of mine asked me to send her a postcard <EOS>

<SOS> do you remember the time you and i went hiking together <EOS>
<SOS> tom could n't get to sleep till after three last night <EOS>
<SOS> my father will be back at the beginning of next month <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think they 'll accept these terms and conditions <EOS>
<SOS> take a look at the faq before you call tech support <EOS>
<SOS> do you want to know who 's supposed to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me that he does n't really care what happens <EOS>
<SOS> whenever i find something i like , it 's too expensive <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom paid far too much for that old saxophone <EOS>
<SOS> a man came up to me and asked for a match <EOS>
<SOS> i thought you and i were supposed to do that together <EOS>
<SOS> i was n't sure you 'd be happy to see me <EOS>
<SOS> let me take you to someplace where you 'll be safe <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm going to be waiting in front of the station <EOS>
<SOS> i understand now why he did n't go to a university <EOS>
<SOS> it 's a good restaurant , but it 's quite expensive <EOS>
<SOS> today is the first day of the rest of your life <EOS>
<SOS> they had to change their schedule because the train arrived late <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary spent the weekend working on a jigsaw puzzle <EOS>
<SOS> i suspect tom and mary are the ones who did that <EOS>
<SOS> how can you be certain you have n't made a mistake <EOS>
<SOS> this looks a lot like the watch tom used to wear <EOS>
<SOS> you did n't tell tom i was coming , did you <EOS>
<SOS> do you have any idea how long tom will be here <EOS>
<SOS> it 's not easy for me to travel alone in japan <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm going to meet a customer in his office today <EOS>
<SOS> i 've already told tom what he should say to mary <EOS>
<SOS> it 's strange that she came home so late at night <EOS>
<SOS> he had had his old one for more than ten years <EOS>
<SOS> tom is willing to do that , but mary is n't <EOS>
<SOS> i was ill at ease because i did n't speak french <EOS>
<SOS> only one student stayed after class to talk to the teacher <EOS>
<SOS> i barely had time to finish this report before the meeting <EOS>
<SOS> in the future , many workers will be replaced by robots <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me that he thought mary would n't eat dessert <EOS>
<SOS> many offices of the municipal government are in the town hall <EOS>
<SOS> that book was boring , so i stopped reading halfway through <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know her , nor do i want to <EOS>
<SOS> do you have any idea how important your test grades are <EOS>
<SOS> tom checked his wallet to see how much money he had <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't understand what the writer was trying to say <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't know tom could play the trombone so well <EOS>
<SOS> you knew that i could do that , did n't you <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary have known each other since they were children <EOS>
<SOS> i 'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor <EOS>
<SOS> i assume you must be a close friend of tom 's <EOS>
<SOS> i thought a cup of coffee might make you feel better <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you to leave <EOS>
<SOS> it 's quite plain that you have n't been paying attention <EOS>
<SOS> i had to stay home all weekend because i was sick <EOS>
<SOS> you ought to tell tom you are n't planning on swimming <EOS>
<SOS> tom needed to decide whether he would continue working in boston <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't believe you really want us to do this <EOS>
<SOS> i knew all along that tom was n't telling the truth <EOS>
<SOS> tom woke up when he heard someone knocking on the door <EOS>
<SOS> how would you like to do us a very big favor <EOS>
<SOS> tom took off his jacket and laid it on the chair <EOS>
<SOS> you 're supposed to be in boston , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> tom was about to go out when it started to rain <EOS>
<SOS> it 's never too late to make amends for harm done <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't think that i did it , do you <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know anyone i can practice speaking french with <EOS>
<SOS> this kind of snow is n't that unusual in this area <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom and mary are too young to get married <EOS>
<SOS> do you have anything to say with regard to this matter <EOS>
<SOS> tom does n't know that mary has spent time in prison <EOS>
<SOS> tom used to spend a lot of time with his grandmother <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know if we can help tom this time <EOS>
<SOS> what you 're saying does n't make any sense to me <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't want to hear about what you did yesterday <EOS>
<SOS> we 're going to rent a car and drive to boston <EOS>
<SOS> tom asked mary why she thought she needed to help john <EOS>
<SOS> tom knew mary said she was n't going to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know if tom will be home this afternoon <EOS>
<SOS> i want to know what the cause of the accident was <EOS>
<SOS> the car broke down , so that we had to walk <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm the one who has the key to the truck <EOS>
<SOS> roughly half of america 's fruits and vegetables come from california <EOS>
<SOS> tom told mary that he 'd go to boston in october <EOS>
<SOS> tom seemed surprised when i told him mary was n't here <EOS>
<SOS> everything was as exactly as i had thought it would be <EOS>
<SOS> i heard that tom wo n't be at your party tonight <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm sure i can find something for you to eat <EOS>
<SOS> i gave in to temptation and began to smoke a cigarette <EOS>
<SOS> i asked tom to email me the pictures he took yesterday <EOS>
<SOS> nobody told us tom and mary were planning to get married <EOS>
<SOS> i 've decided to stay here for a few more days <EOS>
<SOS> tom came out of the bathroom with only a towel on <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he knew he might be required to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom could n't possibly have done what you claimed he did <EOS>
<SOS> tom is still waiting for mary to make up her mind <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't seem to be aware that mary was crying <EOS>
<SOS> tom is trying to find out what he has to do <EOS>
<SOS> that is n't the main reason tom has to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i always have a lot of fun when i come here <EOS>
<SOS> she advised him not to go out by himself at night <EOS>
<SOS> tom is going to be the next one to do that <EOS>
<SOS> he came to see me any time he felt like it <EOS>
<SOS> i did what i could . it 's your turn now <EOS>
<SOS> it was obvious that tom did n't want to do that <EOS>
<SOS> how come we 're talking about me and not about you <EOS>
<SOS> were you the one who told tom not to do that <EOS>
<SOS> may i come to see you at your office tomorrow morning <EOS>
<SOS> tom had a good reason for wanting to leave the house <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he did n't see anything out of the ordinary <EOS>
<SOS> what would you do if you were in tom 's place <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't watch as much tv as i used to <EOS>
<SOS> tom does n't ever say `` hi '' to his neighbors <EOS>
<SOS> we may need to live in boston for a few years <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary are both pretty conceited , are n't they <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom will ask mary to do that for john <EOS>
<SOS> if you have a question for tom , ask him yourself <EOS>
<SOS> look at those black clouds . it is going to rain <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder whether tom really needed to do that or not <EOS>
<SOS> the man could n't so much as write his own name <EOS>
<SOS> i wonder why tom said that he does n't know mary <EOS>
<SOS> her brother nearly died in a traffic accident nine years ago <EOS>
<SOS> are you the one who taught tom how to do that <EOS>
<SOS> if you are ever in japan , come and see me <EOS>
<SOS> i 've asked tom to show me how to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i 've made a lot of friends since i entered college <EOS>
<SOS> tom thought it would be a good idea to leave early <EOS>
<SOS> he gave up the idea of going to america to study <EOS>
<SOS> we want to hire someone to help tom on the farm <EOS>
<SOS> it 'll be easy to find someone to rent this house <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm the one who told tom where to find you <EOS>
<SOS> it 's easier to make money when you already have some <EOS>
<SOS> tom is the one who advised mary to stop doing that <EOS>
<SOS> i 'd like a cup of coffee , too , please <EOS>
<SOS> tom started laughing when i told him about what had happened <EOS>
<SOS> tom stood by the gate , drinking from a water bottle <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he does n't think mary wanted to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm going to stay there for a couple of days <EOS>
<SOS> you worry about helping tom and let me worry about mary <EOS>
<SOS> how long did it take tom to explain that to mary <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm trying to figure out a way to help you <EOS>
<SOS> i did everything the way tom told me to do it <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary are both swimming now , are n't they <EOS>
<SOS> the man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary are both very careless , are n't they <EOS>
<SOS> tom told his son not to speak with his mouth full <EOS>
<SOS> when was the last time you went to boston with tom <EOS>
<SOS> tom thought mary could do that if she had some help <EOS>
<SOS> a man 's heart is about as large as his fist <EOS>
<SOS> things have n't been the same around here since tom left <EOS>
<SOS> i told tom to swim a little every day for exercise <EOS>
<SOS> i was the one who convinced tom to stop doing that <EOS>
<SOS> do you believe i have a chance to get that position <EOS>
<SOS> mt . fuji is higher than any other mountain in japan <EOS>
<SOS> tom hanged himself using the belt that mary had given him <EOS>
<SOS> they stopped talking as soon as i came into the room <EOS>
<SOS> i think we can come up with better plan than this <EOS>
<SOS> right now , i want you to buy me a drink <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm not the only one who could n't do that <EOS>
<SOS> you think i work for tom , but i do n't <EOS>
<SOS> i really did n't want to play in tom 's band <EOS>
<SOS> i think it must 've been tom who broke the window <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't seem to know anything about mary 's past <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't seem to be aware that mary did that <EOS>
<SOS> why do n't you tell me how you think it happened <EOS>
<SOS> i could refuse to do that , but i wo n't <EOS>
<SOS> she has been looking after her sick sister for ten years <EOS>
<SOS> tom was so out of breath that he could hardly speak <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me there was someone who wanted to see me <EOS>
<SOS> i forgot to tell tom and mary to bring their lunch <EOS>
<SOS> tom is the one who 's been taking care of that <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't want to start anything i ca n't finish <EOS>
<SOS> now that his father was dead , he owned the store <EOS>
<SOS> we still do n't know what 's going to happen next <EOS>
<SOS> i joined a gym a few years back to lose weight <EOS>
<SOS> we could meet downtown . would that be convenient for you <EOS>
<SOS> the friend who i thought would pass the exam failed it <EOS>
<SOS> i still believe the internet is not a place for children <EOS>
<SOS> tom should 've done that the way you told him to <EOS>
<SOS> i know that some of your students do n't like you <EOS>
<SOS> young people are not shy about the future of this country <EOS>
<SOS> no matter what you say , i did see the man <EOS>
<SOS> he saw at a glance that his daughter had been crying <EOS>
<SOS> would it be possible for me to get something to drink <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm willing to help you if you want me to <EOS>
<SOS> the only problem is we do n't know where to start <EOS>
<SOS> how can i be a better dad and a better husband <EOS>
<SOS> tom 's mustache looks pretty good , do n't you think <EOS>
<SOS> the truth is that i do n't know anything about it <EOS>
<SOS> i think i wo n't be able to go swimming today <EOS>
<SOS> i was looking for tom , but he found me first <EOS>
<SOS> falling in love is the most natural thing in the world <EOS>
<SOS> tom realized how small he was compared to the other boys <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think tom has to go to school tomorrow <EOS>
<SOS> he is going to be a doctor when he grows up <EOS>
<SOS> i want to have a talk with him about the matter <EOS>
<SOS> i remember being introduced to him at a party last year <EOS>
<SOS> please tell tom to buy some bread on the way home <EOS>
<SOS> the tunnel caved in because of the earthquake the other day <EOS>
<SOS> i thought it might be fun to try to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't care what tom does with his own money <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think it 's up to you to decide <EOS>
<SOS> i forgot just how fun you are to hang out with <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me that he has no intention of marrying you <EOS>
<SOS> tom 's parents have decided to punish tom for doing that <EOS>
<SOS> how much money do you think tom has in the bank <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't even know how to write his own name <EOS>
<SOS> i kicked my son out of the house three months ago <EOS>
<SOS> you 're a better skier than me , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> do i really need to be at the meeting this afternoon <EOS>
<SOS> she changed her mind again , which made us all angry <EOS>
<SOS> behind the house there is a brick oven for baking bread <EOS>
<SOS> do to others as you would have them do to you <EOS>
<SOS> i 'd like to believe that tom told us the truth <EOS>
<SOS> i have been to the station to see my uncle off <EOS>
<SOS> sometimes i go to school by bus and sometimes i walk <EOS>
<SOS> what was the problem you wanted to talk to me about <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i had a little more time to finish this <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think we 're right for each other anymore <EOS>
<SOS> every one of us is more or less interested in art <EOS>
<SOS> are you saying tom is n't the one who helped you <EOS>
<SOS> is there someplace around here that can fix a flat tire <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm sure tom 's name is n't on the list <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm pretty sure tom has fallen in love with mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom likes to be busy and hates sitting around doing nothing <EOS>
<SOS> tom still is n't used to the way things work here <EOS>
<SOS> it takes twenty minutes to walk from the station to school <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary got married when they were still very young <EOS>
<SOS> tom cleaned the top of the table with a wet rag <EOS>
<SOS> if you do n't want to know , do n't ask <EOS>
<SOS> tom intends to live in boston for more than a year <EOS>
<SOS> what would you say if i told you i was quitting <EOS>
<SOS> i told tom he should n't eat anything that mary cooked <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't have to help us , but he did <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i had the courage to speak about my feelings <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't like a world where things change so slowly <EOS>
<SOS> whether or not we play an encore depends on the audience <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow i 'll go to his house to pick him up <EOS>
<SOS> all of you are familiar with the truth of the story <EOS>
<SOS> you 're doing that the wrong way , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> was tom the one who showed you how to do that <EOS>
<SOS> this is what my mother gave me when i got married <EOS>
<SOS> there is a half empty bottle of wine in the fridge <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't yet know what we 're supposed to do <EOS>
<SOS> a considerable amount of money was appropriated for the national defense <EOS>
<SOS> the man you saw in my office yesterday is from belgium <EOS>
<SOS> tom walked into the kitchen , carrying a bag of groceries <EOS>
<SOS> tom 's house is at least twice as big as mine <EOS>
<SOS> it 's one of the stupidest things i 've ever done <EOS>
<SOS> i 've come this far , so i 'll keep going <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he needed to ask me a few more questions <EOS>
<SOS> i love to spend time trying to put together a puzzle <EOS>
<SOS> i think i have a way to save you some time <EOS>
<SOS> how did tom know he was supposed to be here today <EOS>
<SOS> no one in the class runs as fast as he does <EOS>
<SOS> we have wanted to visit the city for a long time <EOS>
<SOS> i 'd like to find out who tom got that from <EOS>
<SOS> so , tom , what can i do for you today <EOS>
<SOS> i get the feeling that you do n't want me here <EOS>
<SOS> i think it 's time for me to apologize to her <EOS>
<SOS> the earth came into existence about five thousand million years ago <EOS>
<SOS> i called your office today , but you were n't in <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom would 've come if you 'd invited him <EOS>
<SOS> tom was just trying to get a rise out of mary <EOS>
<SOS> he was n't the same as i thought he 'd be <EOS>
<SOS> which do you like best , apples , oranges or grapes <EOS>
<SOS> tom hugged mary tightly and never wanted to let her go <EOS>
<SOS> people can easily start loving , but not so easily stop <EOS>
<SOS> perhaps you should wait until tom gets here to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom managed to sell his car for a lot of money <EOS>
<SOS> he may be clever , but he often makes careless mistakes <EOS>

<SOS> it wo n't be all that easy to do that <EOS>
<SOS> how do i know you 're telling me the truth <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't believe that you actually got into harvard <EOS>
<SOS> tom finished writing the report in less than three hours <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he did n't need to do that now <EOS>
<SOS> there was an air of mystery about the whole affair <EOS>
<SOS> tom said i was the one who should do that <EOS>
<SOS> they wanted to ban slavery everywhere in the united states <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think tom will give you the keys <EOS>
<SOS> tom decided to do what he could to help mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom checked his rearview mirror before pulling out into traffic <EOS>
<SOS> i thought mary said she did n't have a boyfriend <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't make that decision without consulting tom first <EOS>
<SOS> i was just hanging out with some of my friends <EOS>
<SOS> i have to make the best of that small room <EOS>
<SOS> being tired , he went to bed earlier than usual <EOS>

<SOS> i should 've kissed you when i had the chance <EOS>
<SOS> i am sure your promotion was timely and well deserved <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm going to town for flour and other supplies <EOS>
<SOS> the people of the united states fought for their independence <EOS>

<SOS> i think we should n't tell tom about what happened <EOS>
<SOS> i heard that you went to see tom last night <EOS>
<SOS> all of tom 's friends thought that he was rich <EOS>
<SOS> i have something i have to talk to you about <EOS>
<SOS> can you remember the first word you learned in french <EOS>
<SOS> you 're just the person we 've been looking for <EOS>

<SOS> i want to know why tom is still not married <EOS>
<SOS> tom has finally done what we asked him to do <EOS>
<SOS> tom should probably tell mary what he has to do <EOS>
<SOS> we 'll never forget what you 've done for us <EOS>
<SOS> let 's concentrate on what needs to be done today <EOS>
<SOS> i like elvis presley . what singer do you like <EOS>
<SOS> he looked so funny that i could n't help laughing <EOS>
<SOS> we have to memorize this poem by the next class <EOS>
<SOS> stop ! there 's an old lady crossing the street <EOS>
<SOS> a true scientist would not approach the question this way <EOS>
<SOS> tom is n't going to take a vacation this year <EOS>
<SOS> what would you like to do while you 're here <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think i have the energy for this <EOS>
<SOS> tom hopes that mary wo n't find out the truth <EOS>
<SOS> this place looks just the same as it used to <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't need to hurry . take your time <EOS>
<SOS> it 's not going to be a problem at all <EOS>
<SOS> do n't you want to know why i did that <EOS>
<SOS> i knew tom would love the gift you gave him <EOS>
<SOS> did tom ever tell you how he first met mary <EOS>

<SOS> we found it impossible for us to cross the river <EOS>
<SOS> tom could sing quite well when he was a child <EOS>
<SOS> why did n't you buy more than one of these <EOS>
<SOS> you 'd better not have gone out with my girlfriend <EOS>
<SOS> he is noisy , but otherwise a very nice boy <EOS>
<SOS> this cloth stretches a great deal when it 's washed <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm going to be out of town next week <EOS>
<SOS> tom unplugged the toaster and put it in a box <EOS>

<SOS> tom does n't look very well . is he sick <EOS>
<SOS> tom does n't think he can do that right now <EOS>
<SOS> we 've got to make sure that does n't happen <EOS>
<SOS> all of the shirts that tom gave me are blue <EOS>
<SOS> if tom starts laughing , i probably will , too <EOS>
<SOS> the lighting is poor in this part of the city <EOS>
<SOS> that child may have been kidnapped on his way home <EOS>
<SOS> hey , you know you 're not allowed in here <EOS>

<SOS> i may have put the key somewhere in this room <EOS>
<SOS> tom is too old for mary , is n't he <EOS>
<SOS> as often happens , he slept right through the lesson <EOS>
<SOS> no man can live to be two hundred years old <EOS>
<SOS> tom would n't tell me about what happened to mary <EOS>
<SOS> you 'd better not go out in this cold weather <EOS>
<SOS> i want you to do what you have to do <EOS>
<SOS> i tied my dog to a tree in the garden <EOS>
<SOS> this is n't the way i wanted to remember tom <EOS>
<SOS> when she heard the news , she broke down crying <EOS>
<SOS> i 've never been able to beat tom at chess <EOS>

<SOS> tom said he 'd help me get what i need <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n't remember the last time i did this <EOS>
<SOS> i think tom is a lot better singer than you <EOS>
<SOS> i hid in the woods all behind tom 's house <EOS>
<SOS> it never occurred to me that i might be wrong <EOS>
<SOS> you did n't need to see him to the door <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he had something important to say to mary <EOS>
<SOS> make sure tom does n't leave before i get there <EOS>
<SOS> did you really think tom would get here on time <EOS>
<SOS> the lady that used to work here had to retire <EOS>
<SOS> neither tom nor mary has to go back to boston <EOS>
<SOS> i have a couple of questions i need to ask <EOS>
<SOS> i know this area like the back of my hand <EOS>
<SOS> tom could tell that mary wanted to be somewhere else <EOS>
<SOS> my cousin is the last person to break his promise <EOS>
<SOS> there was n't much news in last night 's newspaper <EOS>
<SOS> tom hoped to find an opportunity to talk to mary <EOS>
<SOS> i got some shampoo in my eyes and it stings <EOS>
<SOS> what time do you want me to wake you up <EOS>
<SOS> tom is the most intelligent guy i 've ever met <EOS>
<SOS> tom knew that he was n't likely to be chosen <EOS>
<SOS> do you have to dress up every day for work <EOS>
<SOS> i got a video cassette recorder cheap at that shop <EOS>
<SOS> the dutch have a reputation for being good at languages <EOS>
<SOS> he buttoned up his coat before walking out the door <EOS>
<SOS> tom tried to convince mary to dye her hair red <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't want anyone to know where we are <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know what i can do to help <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't intend to let that happen ever again <EOS>

<SOS> tom let me know that he wanted to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm thinking of visiting you one of these days <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know if it will be fine tomorrow <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't know that tom was mary 's brother <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't want to go to lunch with tom <EOS>
<SOS> it cost me a fortune to get my car repaired <EOS>
<SOS> i could pick you up on my way to work <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm pretty sure that tom does n't like me <EOS>
<SOS> it 's difficult for me to express myself in french <EOS>
<SOS> tom knew that he was n't going to be chosen <EOS>
<SOS> is it true that tom does n't like to sing <EOS>
<SOS> he must be very angry to say such a thing <EOS>
<SOS> shall we talk about it over a cup of coffee <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary are both married , are n't they <EOS>
<SOS> later , i found out his real name was tom <EOS>
<SOS> tom is probably going to be afraid to do that <EOS>
<SOS> are you going to cut down all the trees here <EOS>
<SOS> do you really think tom would know what to do <EOS>
<SOS> every time i see tom , he 's eating something <EOS>
<SOS> i thought the captain ordered you not to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom currently plays first trumpet in his high school band <EOS>
<SOS> when did tom tell mary to fix the broken chair <EOS>
<SOS> the time will come when your dream will come true <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm the only person who had to do that <EOS>
<SOS> all things considered , i 'd rather be in boston <EOS>
<SOS> tom is coming to stay with us for a week <EOS>
<SOS> tom looks as if he has n't eaten in days <EOS>
<SOS> tom should be out of the hospital by next saturday <EOS>
<SOS> what 're the chances i 'll actually get the job <EOS>
<SOS> did n't i tell you to take out the garbage <EOS>
<SOS> i want to talk to tom and i mean now <EOS>
<SOS> tom and mary are both there , are n't they <EOS>
<SOS> tom should tell mary why he wants to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i had to make a choice between tom and mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom could n't possibly have opened that door by himself <EOS>
<SOS> how did tom know that mary would n't be here <EOS>
<SOS> tom is n't as disorganized as he used to be <EOS>
<SOS> when i grow up , i want to be king <EOS>
<SOS> if anyone could do that , it would be tom <EOS>
<SOS> tom is likely to be tired when he gets home <EOS>
<SOS> i like this coat . may i try it on <EOS>
<SOS> you told tom to say that , did n't you <EOS>
<SOS> can i ask why this is so important to you <EOS>
<SOS> she acted as if she did n't care what happened <EOS>
<SOS> you 're not old enough to drive , are you <EOS>
<SOS> maybe you could learn a thing or two from tom <EOS>
<SOS> i promise i wo n't tell anyone where it is <EOS>
<SOS> luckily , both of the drivers were wearing seat belts <EOS>
<SOS> tom is a teacher , too , is n't he <EOS>
<SOS> the whole thing turned out to be a ponzi scheme <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't expect the meeting to last so long <EOS>
<SOS> you had better not go out in this bad weather <EOS>
<SOS> it 's not going to be difficult to do this <EOS>
<SOS> i came close to throwing away all these old photos <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm not used to this kind of hard work <EOS>
<SOS> i just want you to make a good first impression <EOS>
<SOS> we 'll go hiking tomorrow if the weather 's good <EOS>
<SOS> there 's nothing i can do to help you now <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll have her call you when she gets back <EOS>
<SOS> i think we need to ask tom to help us <EOS>
<SOS> my friend sent me a letter asking how i was <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm not angry at you , just very disappointed <EOS>
<SOS> tom said that he was glad that you 're back <EOS>
<SOS> the food at that restaurant is too spicy for me <EOS>
<SOS> such things often happen by accident rather than by design <EOS>
<SOS> tom is going to have to do that by himself <EOS>
<SOS> tom was n't able to find a place to park <EOS>
<SOS> this is one of the most popular restaurants in boston <EOS>
<SOS> tom ran to the door and tried to open it <EOS>
<SOS> how many hours of sleep do you get every night <EOS>
<SOS> are you saying tom did n't need to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't know that tom was mary 's nephew <EOS>
<SOS> tell me about some of the places you 've visited <EOS>
<SOS> tom can sleep in my bed if he wants to <EOS>
<SOS> once upon a time , there lived a cruel king <EOS>
<SOS> tom picked up the bottle and poured himself a drink <EOS>
<SOS> i have n't yet read the book tom lent me <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll come by and pick you up tomorrow morning <EOS>
<SOS> i 'd like you to meet my sister , mary <EOS>
<SOS> i 'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow <EOS>
<SOS> tom should 've given mary more time to do that <EOS>
<SOS> the children went to school in spite of the rain <EOS>
<SOS> what tom told us the other day was n't true <EOS>
