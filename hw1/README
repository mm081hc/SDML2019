data:

  put training data, testing data, sample submission and citation data here.

Preprocessing:

  adj_matrix.py: producing adjacent matrix from original citation graph.
  bag_of_words.py: producing node feature for GCN by applying bag-of-words for paper abstract.
  category_onehot.py: producing onehot encoding for paper category.

Model:

  Bert: train model using bert_base_uncased, add category, simularity and citation features
  XLNet: train model using xlnet_large_cased
  GCN: train model using GCN (pygcn package)

Ensemble:

  ensemble_final.py: ensemble models by average the predicted probability

lib:

  pygcn/ : third-party source code of GCN on pytorch
  TA_sample.py: TA's sample code

Reproduce best result:

  python3 ensemble_final.py <output_file>
